Code-shape is a tool that uses [Tree-sitter] to extract a shape of code definitions from a source code file.
The tool uses the same language parsers that are installed for [Tree-sitter CLI][tree-sitter-cli].

## Installation

To install the `code-shape` CLI it's possible to use Rust's Cargo package manager:

```sh
cargo install code-shape
```

## Usage

To start using the tool it's needed to do some preparation.

### Prerequsites

1. Install [Tree-sitter CLI][tree-sitter-cli].
1. Run `tree-sitter init-config` that creates a config file like `~/.config/tree-sitter/config.json` in Tree-sitter's [config dir].
1. Create a directory where installed parsers would be located and add it in `"parser-directories"` list in Tree-sitter's config file.
1. Clone Tree-sitter [parsers][tree-sitter parsers] for required languages to the parsers directory.

### Define extraction query

To make it possible to extract a shape of definitions from some source code file for some language, it's needed to define a [query]. To define a new query create a file in a Code-shape's languages [config dir] `~/.config/code-shape/languages/` with an `.scm` suffix like `~/.config/code-shape/languages/c.scm` and put there a set of Tree-sitter [query] patterns like:

```scheme
; C language function declarations
(declaration
    [
        (function_declarator
            declarator: (identifier) @fn.declaration.name
        )
        (_
            (function_declarator
                declarator: (identifier) @fn.declaration.name
            )
        )
    ]
)

; C language function pointer declarations
(declaration
    [
        (init_declarator
            (function_declarator
                (_ (_ declarator: (identifier) @fn.pointer.declaration.name))
            )
        )
        (init_declarator
            (_
                (function_declarator
                    (_ (_ declarator: (identifier) @fn.pointer.declaration.name))
                )
            )
        )
    ]
)

; C language function definitions
(function_definition
    [
        (function_declarator
            declarator: (identifier) @fn.name
        )
        (_
            (function_declarator
                declarator: (identifier) @fn.name
            )
        )
    ]
    body: (_) @fn.scope
)

```

It's needed to define captures with special names:

* `<type>.name` is a capture where the `type` may be, e.g., `fn`, `class` or anything else to match a code entity name.
* `<type>.scope` is a special capture that allows for the tool to capture a context of entities and usually are tokens that defines a body of the the entity, e.g., a _function body_.

Examples of the tool output:

```sh
# code-shape --scope source.c tree-sitter/lib/src/alloc.c
fn ts_malloc_default
fn ts_calloc_default
fn ts_realloc_default
fn.pointer.declaration ts_current_malloc
fn.pointer.declaration ts_current_calloc
fn.pointer.declaration ts_current_realloc
fn.pointer.declaration ts_current_free
fn ts_set_allocator

# code-shape examples/foo.c
fn.declaration ts_malloc_default
fn.declaration ts_calloc_default
fn.declaration ts_realloc_default
fn.pointer.declaration ts_current_malloc
fn.pointer.declaration ts_current_calloc
fn.pointer.declaration ts_current_realloc
fn.pointer.declaration ts_current_free
fn foo
fn bar

# code-shape examples/foo.py
class Foo
  def foo
  def bar
    def inner
def one
def two
def wrap
  class Baz
    class Bar
      class Foo
        def func1
          def func2
  def three
def four
```

## Embedded shape queries

For now the tool has [builtin][builtin queries] shape queries for the following language parsers:

* [C](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-c)
* [Python](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-python)
